    history:
      "Lisbon is one of the oldest cities in Western Europe, a Phoenician and Roman port long before it became Portugal's capital in 1256. The great earthquake of 1 November 1755, followed by a tsunami and fires, flattened the lower town and killed tens of thousands, which is why the grid-planned Baixa you walk today looks so different from the tangled Alfama that survived. From here Vasco da Gama sailed to India in 1498, and the tax on that spice trade paid for the Manueline stonework you see at Belem. The 1974 Carnation Revolution, a near-bloodless military coup, ended four decades of dictatorship and is still marked every 25 April.",

The 1618 Defenestration of Prague, when Protestant nobles threw imperial officials out of a castle window, helped trigger the Thirty Years War. Unusually for the region, the historic core came through World War II almost intact, which is why the Gothic and Baroque skyline is so complete. The 1989 Velvet Revolution ended communist rule without violence, and Prague has been the Czech capital ever since.",

It stayed a tiny village for most of a thousand years and only grew into a real town in the 1700s, becoming the capital of a self-governing Iceland in 1918 and of a fully independent republic in 1944, when the country cut its last ties to Denmark. The city had its Cold War moment in 1986, when Reagan and Gorbachev met at Hofdi house and came close to agreeing to scrap their nuclear arsenals. Heated and powered almost entirely by geothermal and hydro energy, it is the world's northernmost capital and the base camp for Iceland's waterfalls, geysers and Northern Lights.",

    history:
      "Malaga is one of the oldest cities in the world, founded by Phoenician traders as Malaka around 770 BC and later a busy Roman port that shipped garum and wine across the empire. From the 8th century it spent nearly 800 years under Moorish rule, which raised the walled Alcazaba and the Gibralfaro castle above the harbour, until the Catholic Monarchs took the city after a long siege in 1487. It is best known worldwide as the birthplace of Pablo Picasso, born on Plaza de la Merced in 1881. For most of the 20th century it was a working port and the gateway to the Costa del Sol resorts, before reinventing itself in the 2010s as an art-and-culture city with the Picasso Museum, the Pompidou and the Carmen Thyssen.",

In the Middle Ages it grew into a powerful duchy under the Visconti and then the Sforza, who raised the great brick castle and drew Leonardo da Vinci into their service. Later centuries passed it between Spanish and Austrian rule before it became a driving force in Italy's 19th-century unification and, in the 20th, in the country's industrial boom. Heavily bombed in the Second World War and rebuilt around a modern skyline, it stands today as Italy's financial, fashion and design capital.",

In the Renaissance it grew rich as a banking and printing centre at the crossroads of European trade fairs, and from the 18th century it became the world capital of silk weaving, worked by the canuts of the Croix-Rousse whose revolts marked the 1830s. It was here that the Lumiere brothers shot the first films and gave birth to cinema in 1895, and during the Second World War the city was a stronghold of the French Resistance. Today Lyon is France's gastronomic capital and a UNESCO World Heritage city, its Renaissance old town and traboules preserved intact.",

For centuries it was ruled as an independent state by powerful prince-archbishops, who grew wealthy on that salt, rebuilt the town in Italian Baroque with its cathedral and squares, and held the hilltop Hohensalzburg fortress through every siege. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born here in 1756, and the city has traded on his name ever since. Salzburg lost its church rulers and was joined to Austria in 1816, the Salzburg Festival was founded in 1920, and the baroque old town was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.",

    history:
      "Hamburg grew from a ninth-century fort on the marshy ground between the Elbe and the Alster into the richest port in northern Germany, and it still calls itself a Free and Hanseatic City after centuries of running its own trade and its own affairs. A charter tradition dating back to 1189 gave its merchants customs privileges on the Elbe, and the city marks that grant every May with the Hafengeburtstag, the harbour birthday. Fire destroyed much of the centre in 1842 and Allied bombing flattened far more in 1943, which is why so much of what you walk through is late nineteenth century red brick or postwar rebuild rather than medieval. The warehouse district of the Speicherstadt, built on oak piles from 1883, and the neighbouring Kontorhaus office quarter with the sharp-prowed Chilehaus were listed together by UNESCO in 2015, and the Elbphilharmonie opened on top of an old cocoa warehouse in January 2017 after a decade of delays and cost overruns.",

When heavy industry collapsed in the 1980s the city was left grey, polluted and jobless, its port in ruins and the Nervion an open sewer. The 1997 opening of Frank Gehry's Guggenheim sparked what planners now call the Bilbao effect, a wholesale regeneration that cleaned the river, tore out the old docks and added Norman Foster's sleek metro and a Santiago Calatrava airport, turning a rust-belt city into a design pilgrimage. Today it is the proud Basque capital of the province of Biscay, defined as much by its cooking and its Athletic Bilbao football club as by the museum that saved it.",

From the 14th century it was a key trading post of the German Hanseatic League, whose merchants ran the Bryggen wharf and grew rich on the stockfish shipped down from the north. Fire repeatedly gutted the tightly packed wooden town, so Bryggen was rebuilt time and again on its old lines and finally UNESCO-listed in 1979.

The two were only merged into a single city in 1850, which is why the compact Upper Town still reads as two distinct quarters today. An earthquake in 1880 wrecked much of the centre and triggered the great rebuilding that produced the Lower Town's museums, parks and Austro-Hungarian facades, laid out in the U-shaped chain of squares known as Lenuci's Green Horseshoe. Capital of independent Croatia since 1991, the city was shaken again in March 2020 by a 5.5-magnitude quake that toppled one of the cathedral's spires, and restoration scaffolding has been part of the skyline ever since.",

That golden century ended in 1585, when Spanish troops took the city and the Dutch republic closed the mouth of the river, cutting the port off from the sea for more than two hundred years and sending its merchants north to Amsterdam. Napoleon reopened the story in 1803 by ordering the first stone docks north of the old centre, the basins you now walk around at Het Eilandje, because he wanted a naval base facing England. The river trade came back in the 19th century along with the diamond trade around Centraal station, and Antwerp today runs the second largest port in Europe while its fashion academy keeps the city's name on shop fronts far from Belgium.",

Rather than copy what was lost, the city used the empty ground as a building site for ideas, opening the Lijnbaan in 1953 as one of Europe's first purpose-built pedestrian shopping streets and then letting architects test the Cube Houses, the Markthal and a full skyline of towers on the same few hundred hectares. The port paid for all of it and kept growing west toward the sea, through Europoort and the reclaimed Maasvlakte, which is why Rotterdam still handles more cargo than any other port in Europe. One older corner survived intact: Delfshaven, the narrow harbour where the Pilgrims boarded the Speedwell in 1620 on their way to England and then America, and where the pre-war brick warehouses still lean over the water.",
